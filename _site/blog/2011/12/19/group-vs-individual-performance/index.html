		<h1>Group vs. Individual Performance</h1>
		<p class="date">Published Monday December 19 2011</p>
		<p>I came across this article at <a href='http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/design-studios-the-good-Thea-bad-and-the-science/'>UXBooth.com</a> about the science behind Design Studios that explores what works and doesn&#8217;t. What&#8217;s amazing is that I still remember what nominal group technique is all the way back from college.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1982, Hill published <a href='http://hci.uma.pt/courses/socialweb/reading_material/7/Hill82.pdf'>the most-cited paper (PDF)</a> on group versus individual performance. Hill found that whether groups or individuals perform better depended on the type of task:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Brainstorming problems:</strong> When brainstorming, research shows that the best results come from having individuals brainstorm on their own and then pooling their ideas. The reasons groups perform worse at brainstorming include: production blocking (when one person talks, the others in the group are inhibited from being productive), social loafing (individuals don’t try as hard when they are judged as a group) and groupthink (individuals are less likely to pursue riskier, idiosyncratic leads in a group). In one experiment, researchers asked subjects to shout and clap as loudly as possible; they found that people clapped a remarkable 20-30% less loudly in a group than individually.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Creativity problems:</strong> When performing a creative task, groups outperform individuals—if all individuals are of similar skill level. However, the research shows that weak and even average members drag down group performance, and that this effect is stronger when the task is more challenging. For difficult creative problems, if a group contains both high- and low-performing individuals, any one of the high-performing individuals would probably out-perform the group on his or her own. For most creative problems, though, it’s safe to assume a group will generally perform as well or better than an individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Complex problems:</strong> Sometimes a group cannot even agree on what the problem is, or it may multiple overlapping sub-problems. For complex problems such as these, groups are about as good as their second-best member. Why? Complex problems usually don’t have intuitively obvious answers, so group members will have to convince one another. Whichever individual best understands the problem, then, will have to convince his peers. The group, then, will only be as good as the next-best individual, and whether he can grasp the solution put forth by the best individual. Since it’s usually hard to predict who would be the strongest individual for a given task, using a group makes sense.</p>
