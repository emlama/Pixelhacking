		<h1>My Ideal Makerspace</h1>
		<p class="date">Published Thursday January 20 2011</p>
		<p>Thesis</p>

<ul>
<li>That the design of a space is crucial to the creativity of its inhabitants.</li>

<li>Relevant alignment of good web UX and good creativity</li>
</ul>

<p>Point 1: Just as a website needs clearly defined features your space needs it&#8217;s functions clearly designed.</p>

<p>Point 2: Just as clear and uncluttered information architecture is important to websites, the same is important to spaces.</p>

<p>Point 3: Just as beautiful and elegant user interfaces are important to making a user feel at home so does what&#8217;s in a space.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outline what I want out of my ideal Co-working and Makerspace</li>

<li>Discuss what isn&#8217;t work for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the last few years as my design sense has grown I&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of how important space is to my creative output. Given this weeks New York Times opinion piece on &#8216;The Rise of the New Groupthink&#8217; and the discussion at CreateBaltimore on Maker/Co-working spaces it&#8217;s worthwhile for me to share what it is that I haven&#8217;t been able to find in Baltimore yet.</p>

<p>As many of you know, the Baltimore Node hosts a weekly open-hack session that draws in ALL sorts of hackers and it usually tends to be a hyper-social happy hour with geeks generally geeking out. When the Node first got started, open-hack seemed like the perfect way for me to set aside hours in a busy week to pursue my creative endenvours and see projects through to completion. Unfortunately, the reality is that our long communal table and open floor plan encourages discussion and what I might characterize as ADD collaboration.</p>

<p>It truley is amazing how much discussion happens but I can&#8217;t seem to think of a single project I&#8217;ve been able to finish while at open-hack or if I can even think of a last time I was able to follow a coherent thought the wholeway through. On the otherhand the times I have had the space to myself I&#8217;ve been able to build out websites, build parts for the arcade cabinet and work my way through hard technical books.</p>

<p>All things considered the Node makes for a great &#8216;Creative Space&#8217; as long as there aren&#8217;t more then a handful of people present. Given that though there are a few things we could do to help maximize the space for indepdent work.</p>

<p>First, partition it off. The open floor plan essentially means that there is no clear dividing lounge between the woodshop, lounge/screening room and coworking desks. I think that needs to change so that chop saws or conversation don&#8217;t interrupt with the thoughts of someone thinking intenstly on a problem.</p>

<p>Second, unclutter it. We&#8217;ve added a ton of shelving space in the past few days but I think it&#8217;s time we get our tools and scrap in order so they&#8217;re not all in our face all the time. Also, what&#8217;s the deal with trash? We need a system for making sure it goes out once a week.</p>

<p>Third, build out some nice desks and tables. Our current communal tables aren&#8217;t bad, they&#8217;re alright but there&#8217;s so much more we could do and I would even suggest that we consider building out a series of &#8216;study desks&#8217; where the expecation is that you don&#8217;t bug people sitting at them.</p>

<p>For awhile I just went with it; people need tours, advice on startin their hackerspace or just someone to talk to. Then I tried fighting it. I would come in with my headphones or try to the shrug discussion off. Now days, I hardly go to open-hacks and only go when I&#8217;m feeling like I want to socialize which is perfectly alright. That is the purpose that open-hacks serve now.</p>

<p>some time to reflect on that I wanted to take a minute to see if I can coherently express what my ideal Co-working/Makerspace looks like as a way to wrap up this weeks discussion on &#8216;The Rise of the New Groupthink&#8217; and the CreateBaltimore&#8217;s discussion about Co-working/Makerspaces in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Susan Cain leads in her opinion piece that &#8220;Solitude is out of fashion.&#8221; which is a statement echoed by a number of people at CreateBaltimore. A number of people expressed the desire for a space that fosters spontaneous interaction and creative collaboration.</p>

<p>She posits that this comes from a meme moving through our society that collaboration is the key to producing great work and in a way it is. In an ever more connected world we need to stand on the shoulders of each other in order to build ever greater works but I agree with Susan that the big messy unstructured spaces we&#8217;ve created aren&#8217;t doing it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another post I have in the works about different techniques that can used to better foster group collaboration so I&#8217;ll save that for later. For now that I&#8217;ve found that I have some pretty general requirements for my ideal Co-working/Makerspace.</p>

<p>The first requirement is that it needs to be attractive. This starts with having tons of natural light, solid warm furniture and an uncluttered feel to it.</p>

<p>The second requirement is that it needs to have nooks and crannies where I can hide away and work in private. More and more I find myself seeking out a reasonably warm and cozy place where I can immerse myself in a book or chunk of code without any distractions for a good period of time.</p>

<p>As more of us move out of the cubicle and into the home office I think we find that we miss the human interaction that comes from working in a big bustling office</p>

<p>Back in July Mindgrub moved from</p>

<p>After our tech communities twitter discussion <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-the-new-groupthink.html?_r=2&amp;src=me&amp;ref=general'>New York Times</a> opinion piece on &#8216;The Rise of the New Groupthink&#8217; and todays discussion session at <a href='http://www.createbaltimore.com'>CreateBaltimore</a> on Co-working/Makerspaces I can say that I&#8217;m coming to some conclusions on what I want out of an ideal creative space.</p>
