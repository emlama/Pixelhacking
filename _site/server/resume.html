  <h1>Matthew James Forr</h1>
  <p>I'm a user loving UX Architect and Production Manager who loves to build software for people.</p>

  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

  <h3>Production Manager – Mindgrub Technologies <small>April 2012 – Present</small></h3>
  <p>With a lot of incoming projects we found ourselves needing a leader to make sure our larger projects would get done not only right but also on time and on budget. After interviewing half a dozen candidates we concluded that none of them would cut it so I offered to step up and wear two hats until we could find the right person.</p>
  <p>I'm still wearing those two hats and things are running smoother these days. As our Production Manager I have been responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding, communicating and protecting the vision of projects through the entire software-development lifecycle</li>
    <li>Tasking developers, designers and account executives with the work required to complete said projects</li>
    <li>Ensuring that all deliverables meet clients expectations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>UX Architect – Mindgrub Technologies <small>May 2011 – Present</small></h3>
  <p>I was hired by Mindgrub to build their UX team and that's what I've been doing. As the Lead UX Architect I'm heavily involved with our clients from the end of the sales process all the way through to the end of the project. Some of those responsibilities include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Producing wireframes, sitemaps, functional requirements, UML diagrams and other necessary documentation to clearly translate the client’s and user’s needs and desires into documentation that all stakeholders can understand and use.</li>
    <li>Facilitating user interviews, surveys, focus groups, card sorts and other user-centered methods in order to understand the target audience.</li>
    <li>Managing the hiring, tasking and career development of a team that consists of one full-time employee, interns and contractors across multiple projects.</li>
    <li>Owning the entire user experience design process at .</li>
    <li>Developing and refining a HTML5/CSS3 prototyping framework using twitter bootstrap, LESS and Jekyll that allows our team to quickly implement ideas, test them and iterate with code that will eventually make it into production.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Front End Web Developer – Euro Discovery <small>February 2010 – May 2011</small></h3>

While there I helped them setup and kickoff their intial social media strategy, figure out how to use Google Analytics to make decisions, fix their computers, build out their website and develop content for the web.</p>
