Hey there and welcome to my new home on the web. I've been meaning to get this site online for the past two months and so it has finally come to be.

Why PixelHacking you ask? Well I've always wanted a separate home for my thoughts and to leave [matthewforr.com](http://matthewforr.com) as a simple informational site. I think PixelHacking is befitting given what I do and was glad when I found the domain name.

In spirit of full disclosure, I must state that despite numerous past attempts at blogging I have yet to have a solid run of regular writing. To help get myself organized and started I have three specific goals in mind:

1. To actively engage in discussions in the web design and development community.
2. To document my progress as I learn new things and push myself to keep learning new things.
3. To improve my skills as a writer and communicator.

So here goes :)
