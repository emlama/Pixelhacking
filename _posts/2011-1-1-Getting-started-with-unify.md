# Getting started with the Unify deliverables framework.

## Introduction to why Unify and alternative solutions.
As many in the agency life know, getting deliverables to clients can be difficult. They often require multiple rounds of revisions and fully documenting everything can be a challenge. I have been working with the EightShapes Unify InDesign framework for about six months now and have found it to be a really good fit with our companies workflow. The framework is composed of InDesign templates, snippets and elements that keep my wireframes organized, allow me to keep track of changes and produce a professional looking document quickly.

In this writeup I'm going to cover the bare minimum of the Unify framework while introducing you to InDesign. By the bare minimum I mean setting up your templates, working with text, working with images, adding a table of contents page and a change history page. In my opinion these are the pages you'll need to start delivering your wireframes or design comps and by time we're done you'll be prepared to strike out on your own.

## Getting Oriented

Once you download the Unify framework you'll see three top level folders. They are as follows:

deliverables >
documentation >
wireframes >

As you can imagine the deliverables folder has elements for deliverables, documention has some PDFs that detail Unify and wireframes has elements for building wireframes in InDesign.

Since this is about building your deliverables we'll be working with the deliverables folder and you can ignore the other two for now.

Most of the elements you're going to be interested in are all in  the deliverables folder so let's dig in and see what's available.

The first thing you'll see in there are four InDesign templates, you can go ahead and open up one of them. You'll notice that it opened up as Untitled-1.ind which is to say everytime you start a new project you can kick it off with this template.

Within the template you'll notice that it has a title page and a single blank page. Take a look at the pages pane, in here you'll see page templates at the top and then actual pages. This where you can insert new pages and choose the page style that you need. Go ahead and drag the 'Chapter' template to the second page. See, now it looks like a Chapter page. Neat huh?

Alright, back to the folder. First thing we should do is dive into the _elements folder. These elements are InDesign Libraries which is to say they're a collection of vector objects and the such. Go ahead and open up the callouts.indl and frames.indl files. Notice how they open up into a context menu, go ahead and drag one of them onto the second page. You can move them around etc etc.

Alright now go to the pages folder. There's a lot more here. These are all templates you can drop on a page to create various kinds of deliverables. Go ahead and open up the
