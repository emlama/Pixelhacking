# Prototyping with HTML/CSS

# Why and when is it appropriate to take this route?
# Nod to other techniques and considerations for them.
# Getting started: the process.

1. Your UX Discovery Process.
- Mental Models/Task Analysis
- Define goals/personas etc
- Do your homework UX work

2. Plan it out. Define your direction and give yourself enough to work with.
- Workflow sketches
- Sitemap layout
- Template definition
- Rough sketches and wireframes

3. Libraries we're going to use.
- HTML5 Boilerplate
-- Serves as one solid template for it all
- Twitter bootstrap
-- Provides grid/tyopgraphy/forms and more to quickly get to laying things out.
- Javascript
-- twitter/bootstrap.js
-- jQuery & jQuery UI
-- underscore.js
- jekyll & jekyll-s3
-- Static Site Generator which pulls everything together
-- Takes YAML Front Matter/Liquid Templates
-- Setup Amazon S3 once and then deploying is east as '$>jekyll-s3'
