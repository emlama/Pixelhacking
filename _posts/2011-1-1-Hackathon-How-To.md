Planning
-sponsors
  Designate one person to handle this duty
  Look for local tech companies that can benefit from being involved in the community.
  For sponsors it's all about what they get their name on leading up to the event
  Offer a website (and t-shirt if possible) with a logo
 For in kind sponsors be sure you are getting a significant amount of work or goods in exchange. Be wary of folks that want to have their name on your event in exchange for media coverage. Also be wary of vendors that are committing to bringing goods during the event. We had our coffee sponsor not show up on us!
-judges
  Develop a rubric that helps make their job easier
  Consider focusing on judges that understand technology, startups or design. 
  Send them and email a week ahead of time letting them know when/where to go and what to expect.

Days Of
-opening
  Give a run down of the schedule what people can expect and then organize a meetup/find a partner session.  
  Find a partner: get people together (we directed folks to move from the opening ceremony to another area afterwards).  Have them present ideas and projects, explain what they can do and what they would need help with. Keep pushing people to present ideas. When folks run out of steam end the session and let people self organize. 
-food
  Set aside an area for food. 
  Plan three meals plus snacks. Set out drinks during the meals, be wary folks will drink through liters of soda, provide alternatives.
