Recently while conducting stakeholder interviews for a library redesign project, I came a cross the term Folksonomy. I made a note to come back and revisit this word as the meanings it instantly conveyed to me seemed worth exploring.

Of course the first place I went was wikipedia to see what the collective mind thinks of the word:

> A folksonomy is a system of classification derived from the practice and method of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize content;[1][2] this practice is also known as collaborative tagging,[3] social classification, social indexing, and social tagging. Folksonomy, a term coined by Thomas Vander Wal, is a portmanteau of folk and taxonomy.
