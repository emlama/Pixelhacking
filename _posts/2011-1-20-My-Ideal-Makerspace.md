Thesis
- That the design of a space is crucial to the creativity of its inhabitants.
- Relevant alignment of good web UX and good creativity

Point 1: Just as a website needs clearly defined features your space needs it's functions clearly designed.

Point 2: Just as clear and uncluttered information architecture is important to websites, the same is important to spaces.

Point 3: Just as beautiful and elegant user interfaces are important to making a user feel at home so does what's in a space.



Objectives:
- Outline what I want out of my ideal Co-working and Makerspace
- Discuss what isn't work for me.

Over the last few years as my design sense has grown I've become increasingly aware of how important space is to my creative output. Given this weeks New York Times opinion piece on 'The Rise of the New Groupthink' and the discussion at CreateBaltimore on Maker/Co-working spaces it's worthwhile for me to share what it is that I haven't been able to find in Baltimore yet.

As many of you know, the Baltimore Node hosts a weekly open-hack session that draws in ALL sorts of hackers and it usually tends to be a hyper-social happy hour with geeks generally geeking out. When the Node first got started, open-hack seemed like the perfect way for me to set aside hours in a busy week to pursue my creative endenvours and see projects through to completion. Unfortunately, the reality is that our long communal table and open floor plan encourages discussion and what I might characterize as ADD collaboration.

It truley is amazing how much discussion happens but I can't seem to think of a single project I've been able to finish while at open-hack or if I can even think of a last time I was able to follow a coherent thought the wholeway through. On the otherhand  the times I have had the space to myself I've been able to build out websites, build parts for the arcade cabinet and work my way through hard technical books.

All things considered the Node makes for a great 'Creative Space' as long as there aren't more then a handful of people present. Given that though there are a few things we could do to help maximize the space for indepdent work.

First, partition it off. The open floor plan essentially means that there is no clear dividing lounge between the woodshop, lounge/screening room and coworking desks. I think that needs to change so that chop saws or conversation don't interrupt with the thoughts of someone thinking intenstly on a problem.

Second, unclutter it. We've added a ton of shelving space in the past few days but I think it's time we get our tools and scrap in order so they're not all in our face all the time. Also, what's the deal with trash? We need a system for making sure it goes out once a week.

Third, build out some nice desks and tables. Our current communal tables aren't bad, they're alright but there's so much more we could do and I would even suggest that we consider building out a series of 'study desks' where the expecation is that you don't bug people sitting at them.

For awhile I just went with it; people need tours, advice on startin their hackerspace or just someone to talk to. Then I tried fighting it. I would come in with my headphones or try to the shrug discussion off. Now days, I hardly go to open-hacks and only go when I'm feeling like I want to socialize which is perfectly alright. That is the purpose that open-hacks serve now.



some time to reflect on that I wanted to take a minute to see if I can coherently express what my ideal Co-working/Makerspace looks like as a way to wrap up this weeks discussion on 'The Rise of the New Groupthink' and the CreateBaltimore's discussion about Co-working/Makerspaces in Baltimore.

Susan Cain leads in her opinion piece that "Solitude is out of fashion." which is a statement echoed by a number of people at CreateBaltimore. A number of people expressed the desire for a space that fosters spontaneous interaction and creative collaboration. 





 She posits that this comes from a meme moving through our society that collaboration is the key to producing great work and in a way it is. In an ever more connected world we need to stand on the shoulders of each other in order to build ever greater works but I agree with Susan that the big messy unstructured spaces we've created aren't doing it.

There's another post I have in the works about different techniques that can used to better foster group collaboration so I'll save that for later. For now that I've found that I have some pretty general requirements for my ideal Co-working/Makerspace.

The first requirement is that it needs to be attractive. This starts with having tons of natural light, solid warm furniture and an uncluttered feel to it.

The second requirement is that it needs to have nooks and crannies where I can hide away and work in private. More and more I find myself seeking out a reasonably warm and cozy place where I can immerse myself in a book or chunk of code without any distractions for a good period of time. 

As more of us move out of the cubicle and into the home office I think we find that we miss the human interaction that comes from working in a big bustling office 



Back in July Mindgrub moved from 

After our tech communities twitter discussion [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-the-new-groupthink.html?_r=2&src=me&ref=general) opinion piece on 'The Rise of the New Groupthink' and todays discussion session at [CreateBaltimore](http://www.createbaltimore.com) on Co-working/Makerspaces I can say that I'm coming to some conclusions on what I want out of an ideal creative space.
