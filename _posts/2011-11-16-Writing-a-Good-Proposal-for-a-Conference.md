1. Write a great description. Needs a thesis as the first sentance, anything but that won't do.
2. Edit it edit edit it!
3. Submit multiple ideas if possible.
4. Note if you're going to do anything interactive/hands on. Those really stand out.
5. If you're going to include a presentation or supporting materials. They better be good. For the most part a slideshow DOESN'T help. They never provide enough information and are a confusing mess of pictures.
6. Avoid refrencing awards and don't use the word 'lively'.
